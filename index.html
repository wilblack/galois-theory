          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Galois Thery (pronounced gal-wha) is a subject in  mathetics that falls under abstract algebra. The theory
          was motivated by the question on the existence of solutions to polynomials with rational coefficients.

          For example

          $$p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

          where a, b, and c or rational numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          From high-school algebra we can recall the roots of this polynomial are given by the <strong>quadratic equation</strong>

          $$x= \pm \sqrt[2]{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{2a}}$$

          <p>Evarsite Galois's story is a trageic one. He was born in 1811 in Bourg La Reine, near Paris France.
            In 1832 he was critically wounded in a duel, taking a bullet to his gut. He died the next day at the age of 20.
          </p>
          <p>
            Galois had studied mathematics at Ã‰cole Normale.
            He sumbitted a paper entitled <em>On the condition that an equation be soluble by radicals</em> in Febuary of 1930.
            The paper was sent to Fourier, but Fourier he died a few months later and the paper was lost.
            Galois had a rebellious streak and was politcally active. This landed him in trouble several times. He was arrested in May of 1831 for allegedly
            making threats to King Louis-Phillipe. He was arrested again on July 14th, 1831, Bastille Day, for wearing
            a uniform of the Artillery of the National Guard. He was carrying several loaded firearms and a dagger.
            He tried to commit suicide while in prison.
          </p>
          <p>
            On May 30, 1832 Galois fought a duel with Perscheux d'Herbinville.
            He was wounded in the duel and died the next day. The reason for the duel was likely over a women.
            Galois's papers were collected by his brother and his friend Chevalier and eventually ended up in the hands of
            mathematician Joesph Liouville. Liousville published these papers in 1846. The papers outlined a new branch of mathematics
            which we now call Galois Theory.
